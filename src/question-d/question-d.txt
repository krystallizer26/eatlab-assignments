D. You have been tasked with designing a database schema for an e-commerce website 
that sells products to customers. The website has the following requirements:
- Customers should be able to create an account, log in, and update their personal 
information such as name, email, and shipping address.
- Products should have a name, description, price, and category. Products may belong to multiple categories.
- Customers should be able to add products to their shopping cart and place an order.
- Orders should have a unique identifier, a customer ID, a status (e.g. "pending", "shipped", "delivered"), 
a total cost, and a list of products.
- Each order should include the product name, quantity, and price at the time the order was placed.
- Products should have an inventory quantity that is updated when an order is placed.
- Customers should be able to leave reviews for products.
Design a database schema that satisfies these requirements. Provide the SQL code to create the tables and any necessary constraints.
